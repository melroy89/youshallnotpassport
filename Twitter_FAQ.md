## General

<details>
<summary>How does this work Twitter Bot/Account?</summary>
<br>
<blockquote>
The bot checks the Premium and Fast Track websites every 30 minutes. If the websites 
are online, or online and busy, the bot will post a tweet. It will then check again
30 minutes later. The statuses on the tweets are therefore only valid for 30 minutes.
You can click the bell symbol (üîî) on the profile if you're using the Twitter mobile
app, this will then send you a push notification when the account tweets.

<summary>The bot hasn't posted in a while, is it still working?</summary>
<br>
<blockquote>
Unless I've changed the code on the main, working code (which I don't unless there is
a big update, then it should be working all the time. To verify, check the account
bio, is the updated time up-to-date? If so, then the code is still working. If not, DM
me.

<summary>How can I pay you back for this service?</summary>
<br>
<blockquote>
Many people ask about how to thank me; I reply charity donations if possible. 
Many have donated to the Trussell Trust on my request but there is also a charity 
close to mine and my families heart too. Almost six years ago my nephew was born 
via emergency c section, he battled hard, but sadly passed away a week later. 
His name was Zachary üíô and our family often raise money for The Grand Appeal  in his 
memory. I‚Äôve set up a pot here:
<br><br>
<a href="https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/donationsforzahary">
Just Giving Page</a>
<br><br>
It‚Äôs not my intentions for people to feel they have to donate to that page, 
Trussell Trust, or anywhere. You‚Äôre all travelling far and wide to get your 
passports and spending ¬£¬£¬£ doing so. I‚Äôm sharing this for those who are able to.
<br><br>
Thank you,
<br><br>

<summary>I have X number of days until I travel. What shall I do?
</summary>
<br>
<blockquote>
This is just my advice and so please use your own judgement.
<br><br>
<b><u>If under 2 weeks</u></b><br>
If you can use the Premium Service you may be able to get an appointment in time.
Fast Track is unlikely as it takes a week from the appointment to receive the passport.
Another option is to contact the
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/passport-advice-line">passport advice line</a> 
to get an emergency appointment as you are within 2 weeks of travel.
<br><br>
<b><u>If 2-6 weeks</u></b><br>
It might be best to book a Fast Track appointment (released up to 3 weeks in advance). 
Although closer to 6 weeks you are the more likely it is you will get your passport back in time
using the standard service. If you fall within 2 weeks of travel you can contact the
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/passport-advice-line">passport advice line</a> to ask for a Fast Track upgrade.
<br><br>
<b><u>If 6-10 weeks</u></b><br>
There is no real advice or perfect option for this time-frame I'm afraid. The closer to
10 weeks you are the more likely it is you will get your passport back in time
using the standard service. If you fall within 2 weeks of travel you can contact the
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/passport-advice-line">passport advice line</a>  to ask for a Fast Track upgrade.
<br><br>
<b><u>10+ weeks</u></b><br>
For this, you should be able to get your passport back in time using the standard
service. If you fall within 2 weeks of travel you can contact the
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/passport-advice-line">passport advice line</a>  to ask for a Fast Track upgrade.

<summary>I‚Äôve not received a confirmation email of my booking, what do I do?
</summary>
<br>
<blockquote>
If you have screenshot proof of your appointment on the confirmation page, and/or
confirmation of payment, then you should be ok. But contact the 
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/passport-advice-line">passport advice line</a>
to be sure. 
<br><br>
HMPO are starting to email people in this position now with the following:
<br><br>
<blockquote>
Dear Customer.<br>

Our records show that you made a payment for the 1-week Fast Track or Online
Premium passport service. However, due to a delay in completing the transaction,
you will not have received confirmation of the booking, and we do not have
a record of your chosen slot on our systems.

<b>What should you do</b>

Your booking will be honoured, however you will be asked on your arrival at
the appointment to provide proof of payment, and a copy of this email,
as evidence of your booking. Your appointment may be postponed if this evidence
is not provided when requested.

We're sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.

<summary>I have a damaged passport, can I used the Premium Service?
</summary>
<br>
<blockquote>
HM Passport Office classes your passport as damaged if:<br>
	‚Ä¢	you can‚Äôt read any of your details<br>
	‚Ä¢	the laminate cover has come away<br>
	‚Ä¢	there‚Äôs an ink or chemical spillage on any of the pages<br>
	‚Ä¢	there‚Äôs discolouring of your personal details (for example your name or date of birth) or on the official observations page<br>
	‚Ä¢	any of the pages are ripped, missing or detached<br>
	‚Ä¢	the chip is damaged or showing through the back cover (e-passports only)<br>
	‚Ä¢	there‚Äôs any damage to the back cover (for example ripped, bite marks or staple holes)<br>
	‚Ä¢	there‚Äôs excess water damage
<br><br>
If any of these are true, then you will need to use the Fast Track service.

<details>
<summary>Does the Premium service reserve my appointment selection?</summary>
<br>
<blockquote>
Yes, it appears as though when you click an appointment time and date this is reserved
for you once you confirm your selection. You then have X minutes to complete your 
application (photo upload, application details and pay). The slot will be made open 
to booking for someone else if you do not finish in time. Therefore, please have your
photo and payment details ready at hand.</blockquote>

do I do?</summary>

Keep refreshing and you should hopefully get through and be able to book
an appointment.

## Transfers and Cancellations
<details>
<summary>Can I change the date of my Fast Track appointment?
</summary>
<br>
<blockquote>
Yes, as long as you're not within 48 hours of the appointment. You can
change the appointment date by clicking the link in your confirmation email
when the Fast Track service is next online. Then you will be able to select
a different date.
</blockquote>
<br><br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I transfer my appointment to someone else?

not clear it can be done.
</blockquote>

## Advice about delays in standard passport applications
<details>
<summary>I have a standard application in progress but haven‚Äôt received it yet, 
what can I do?
</summary>
<br>
<blockquote>
If you are within two weeks of travel, contact the 
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/passport-advice-line">passport advice line</a> and
they may be able to offer you a Fast Track upgrade. Otherwise, you can write and
request to withdraw your standard application in order to book an online urgent
appointment. However, it can take up to 3 weeks for your original application
to be cancelled.
</blockquote>
<br><br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>I have a standard application being processed, can I book a fast track 
or premium?
</summary>
<br>
<blockquote>
You cannot have more than one application in progress. You would need to contact
the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/passport-advice-line">passport advice line</a>
and withdraw your original application to use the Fast Track or Premium service. This
can take up to 3 weeks to complete.
</blockquote>
