<summary>How does this work Twitter Bot/Account?</summary>
<br>
<blockquote>
The bot checks the Premium and Fast Track websites every minute. If the websites 
have a status change (online to offline, or offline to online) the bot will post a tweet.
The bot then posts the appointments table it sees. The bot keeps checking, and if more
appointments are added it will post again to Twitter.

<summary>I have a standard application being processed, can I book a online fast track 
or premium?
</summary>
<br>

You cannot have more than one application in progress. You would need to contact
the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/passport-advice-line">passport advice line</a>
and withdraw your original application to use the Fast Track or Premium service. This
can take up to 3 weeks to complete.

<summary>The bot hasn't posted in a while, is it still working?</summary>
<br>
<blockquote>
Unless I've changed the code on the main, working code (which I don't unless there is
a big update, then it should be working all the time. To verify, check the account
bio, is the updated time up-to-date? If so, then the code is still working. If not, DM
me.

<summary>How can I pay you back for this service?</summary>
<br>
<blockquote>
Many people ask about how to thank me; I reply charity donations if possible. 
Many have donated to the Trussell Trust on my request but there is also a charity 
close to mine and my families heart too. Almost six years ago my nephew was born 
via emergency c section, he battled hard, but sadly passed away a week later. 
His name was Zachary üíô and our family often raise money for The Grand Appeal  in his 
memory. I‚Äôve set up a pot here:
<br><br>
<a href="https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/donationsforzahary">
Just Giving Page</a>
<br><br>
It‚Äôs not my intentions for people to feel they have to donate to that page, 
Trussell Trust, or anywhere. You‚Äôre all travelling far and wide to get your 
passports and spending ¬£¬£¬£ doing so. I‚Äôm sharing this for those who are able to.
<br><br>
Thank you,
<br><br>

There is no set time. Typically, they go online every day of the week.

Lately (as of 04/08/2022), the patterns seem to be:<br>
1. Fast Track going online at around 09:00<br>
2. Premium going online at 10:00<br>

</summary>
<br>

If you have screenshot proof of your appointment on the confirmation page, and/or
confirmation of payment, then you should be ok. But contact the

to be sure. 
<br><br>
HMPO are starting to email people in this position now with the following:
<br><br>
<blockquote>
Dear Customer.<br>

Our records show that you made a payment for the 1-week Fast Track or Online
Premium passport service. However, due to a delay in completing the transaction,
you will not have received confirmation of the booking, and we do not have
a record of your chosen slot on our systems.

<b>What should you do</b>

Your booking will be honoured, however you will be asked on your arrival at
the appointment to provide proof of payment, and a copy of this email,
as evidence of your booking. Your appointment may be postponed if this evidence
is not provided when requested.

We're sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.

<summary>I have a lost or damaged passport, can I used the Premium Service?
</summary>
<br>
<blockquote>
You cannot use the service for a lost or damaged passport. HM Passport Office classes your passport as damaged if:<br>
	‚Ä¢	you can‚Äôt read any of your details<br>
	‚Ä¢	the laminate cover has come away<br>
	‚Ä¢	there‚Äôs an ink or chemical spillage on any of the pages<br>
	‚Ä¢	there‚Äôs discolouring of your personal details (for example your name or date of birth) or on the official observations page<br>
	‚Ä¢	any of the pages are ripped, missing or detached<br>
	‚Ä¢	the chip is damaged or showing through the back cover (e-passports only)<br>
	‚Ä¢	there‚Äôs any damage to the back cover (for example ripped, bite marks or staple holes)<br>
	‚Ä¢	there‚Äôs excess water damage
<br><br>
If any of these are true, then you will need to use the Fast Track service.

<details>
<summary>Does the Premium service reserve my appointment selection?</summary>
<br>
<blockquote>
Yes, it appears as though when you click an appointment time and date this is reserved
for you once you confirm your selection. You then have X minutes to complete your 
application (photo upload, application details and pay). The slot will be made open 
to booking for someone else if you do not finish in time. Therefore, please have your
photo and payment details ready at hand.</blockquote>

If you are within two weeks of travel, contact the
