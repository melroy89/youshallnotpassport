I created [@ukpassportcheck](www.twitter.com/ukpassportcheck) at the start of May 2022. I wanted to use this space to let you know why I created the account and the impact it has had.

A little about me first. I am 33, live in Cardiff with my wife and our two boys. I try and teach our eldest, who is almost four, the most important thing in life is to leave a positive impact on the planet. We often go litter-picking outside the shops opposite our house. There is a barbers there, and they often give him a sweet or two for his efforts. 

I created the account because my Mum needed to get an urgent passport appointment. At the time, there was confusion around when the 6-month rule from passport expiry was taken from: the expiry date or ten years from the issue date. This had led to several stories in the media about passengers being turned away at the airport from certain airlines ‚Äì wrongly it turns out. My Mum fell into this grey area, and we had a big family holiday at the start of June. Coupled with this, when urgent appointments are added was very random. There were some reports of appointments being added at midnight ‚Äì which turned out to be wrong.

I decided to create a fairly simple web-scraping Python tool to scrape the appointments page every 30 minutes and flag to me when appointments were available. After getting my mum an appointment, I decided to release it as a Twitter bot. I uploaded all the code to GitHub. It was free to use, and free for others to see how I managed it.

Since May the account has grown massively. The code behind the account has changed too. Initially it was running every 30 minutes, but I then changed this to run every minute instead. After this, I added some code to scrape the appointments tables and post to Twitter. Lastly, as appointments sometimes were added throughout the day, whilst the service was online, I added some code to check for new appointments and post to Twitter if new appointments were uploaded.

Whilst the accounts successes are often measured in the number of Twitter followers, or number of media articles. The real successes come in the form of messages I have received by thousands of people either publicly or via direct message. I‚Äôve received messages from people who have undergone horrific domestic abuse, and needed a new passport to begin their new life. Another message involved someone who was living abroad, who needed to come home with their family to look after their mum who suffered from a serious mental health condition ‚Äì they were stuck between the wait time for passport renewals, notice periods for their current country, and legal processes, and were losing hope. Countless others too needed a passport to see dying relatives abroad, or were on the verge of losing their job, or not being able to start a new one. I‚Äôm so happy to have been able to help so many people.

Also, this account has helped me raise over ¬£3,000 for Bristol Children‚Äôs hospital in memory of my nephew Zachary. Zachary died aged just one week back in 2016. I have been overwhelmed with the donations and messages. My mum and family read them and are equally as thankful as me for all your donations. Thank you.

Although the accounts code runs automatically, without me needing to do anything; I spend a lot of time answering peoples questions. People often ask me how I find the time. How I found the time to create and update the code. And how I continue to find the time to answer questions. The truth is, I like to help people. And this is my way of helping. I understand the stress the system is causing people. Therefore, I hope the account ‚Äì whether that‚Äôs through the service posts, my replies, my statistics in the newsletters ‚Äì reduce the stress, even if they cannot sometimes fully solve people‚Äôs problems.

Thanks for your time in reading this.

Michael

_We will always remember you Zachary ‚ù§Ô∏è_
